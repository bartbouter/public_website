    <h1>Kubernetes Sidecar Containers</h1>
    <p>
        A sidecar container is a secondary container that runs alongside the main container within a Kubernetes pod.
        It helps to enhance or extend the functionality of the main container without modifying its code.
    </p>
    <h2>Benefits of Sidecar Containers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Separation of concerns: Sidecar containers allow you to separate different concerns or functionalities into separate containers.</li>
        <li>Code reusability: Sidecar containers can be reused across multiple pods, reducing code duplication.</li>
        <li>Flexibility: Sidecar containers can be added or removed independently, providing flexibility in managing the application stack.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Example Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
        Some common use cases for sidecar containers include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Logging: A sidecar container can handle logging and send logs to a centralized logging system.</li>
        <li>Monitoring: A sidecar container can collect metrics and send them to a monitoring system.</li>
        <li>Security: A sidecar container can handle authentication and authorization for the main container.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Sidecar containers are a powerful concept in Kubernetes that allow you to extend the functionality of your applications
        without modifying their code. They provide flexibility, code reusability, and separation of concerns, making it easier
        to manage complex application stacks.
